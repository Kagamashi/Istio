- Distributed Tracing: Provides deep visibility into how requests flow across microservices in Istio, helping identify performance bottlenecks and failures.
- Root Cause Analysis: Simplifies the process of troubleshooting complex issues by visualizing the entire request flow and isolating the service or operation causing issues.
- Seamless Integration: Works out of the box with Istioâ€™s Envoy sidecars, automatically collecting traces for all requests without requiring code changes.

Jaeger is an essential component for understanding and optimizing the performance of microservices running on Istio, providing insights into request flows, performance, and failures across the service mesh.
