Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system that integrates with Istio to collect metrics from the Envoy proxies running as sidecars alongside each service in the mesh. It scrapes metrics such as request counts, latencies, success rates, and error rates from Istio's control plane and data plane.

Key Features:
- Metrics Collection: Prometheus gathers metrics from Envoy sidecars, providing insights into service health and traffic behavior.
- Service Mesh Monitoring: Metrics such as request volume, latency, and error rates are captured for every service-to-service interaction.
- Alerting: Prometheus can be configured to send alerts when certain thresholds (e.g., high error rates or latency) are breached, helping detect issues in real-time.
