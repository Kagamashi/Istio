- Dashboards: Grafana visualizes Prometheus metrics, offering rich, customizable dashboards that display traffic, errors, latency, and resource usage across services.
- Real-time Monitoring: Provides real-time visual monitoring of the Istio service mesh, allowing teams to track key performance metrics and detect issues quickly.
- Pre-built Integration: Istio comes with pre-configured Grafana dashboards that make it easy to start monitoring the mesh without extensive setup.
