| **Feature**              | **Linkerd**                                | **Istio**                                    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                 | Simplicity and ease of use                 | Feature-rich but complex                     |
| **Proxy**                 | **Linkerd Proxy** (lightweight, Rust-based) | **Envoy Proxy** (powerful, resource-heavy)   |
| **Traffic Management**    | Basic (load balancing, retries, timeouts)  | Advanced (canary releases, fault injection)  |
| **Security**              | mTLS enabled by default                    | mTLS, RBAC, JWT validation, fine-grained policies |
| **Observability**         | Simplified (out-of-the-box metrics)        | Advanced, integrates with external tools     |
| **Installation**          | Easy, minimal configuration                | More complex, requires tuning                |
| **Performance**           | Lightweight, minimal overhead              | Higher resource consumption, customizable    |
| **Use Case**              | Small to medium Kubernetes clusters        | Large, complex Kubernetes environments       |
